# MiniVHD - Minimalist VHD implementation in C

**MiniVHD** is a minimalist implementation of read/write/creation of VHD files. It is designed to read and write to VHD files at a sector level. It does not enable file access, or provide mounting options. Those features are left to more advanced libraries and/or the OS.

**Please note, A re-write of this library is currently in progress. If you need the old (incomplete) version for whatever reason, it can be found in the `minivhd-v1` branch of this repository**
